JuiceSSH Translations
======

We want **your** help translating JuiceSSH to other languages. In return for your help we're offering **free upgrades to JuiceSSH Pro** for anybody that makes contribution via an accepted pull request.

To contribute either create a new translation:

 1. Fork this GitHub repository
 2. [Lookup the locale code](http://www.localeplanet.com/icu/) for the language you want to translate to 
 3. Copy the existing `en_GB` folder and use it as your starting base
 4. Translate!
 5. Commit the changes back and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) 

... or simply update an existing one if you spot an error/problem with the current translation.
 
Once translation pull requests are accepted, we will email you a JuiceSSH Pro activiation license. Your translation will then be verified and included in the next update to the JuiceSSH app.
